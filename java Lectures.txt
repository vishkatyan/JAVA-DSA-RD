Day1 Java training
Step1: JDK Install from google
 Drive c< Program files< Java<bin -> Copy the path
 Right click on this PC< Properties< search for environment< Path variable<edit<new<paste the copy

Day2
*File name should be PascalCase.e.g., FirstClass
*Java is based on OOPs.
*Everything is done by using objects.
*Every program in java starts with a class.
*Every class has some features.
*File name and class name should be same.
*Should include comments to make understand easily.
*Source code (.java)
*Compile(javac).
*javac<SourceFileName>.java
*We'll get byte code(.class).
*To open terminal to get source code compile (ctrl+`).
*Compile--> File Name but on Compile byte code will be make by class name.
*To run--> java<BytecodeName>(Class Name).
*Main method or main functon--> Entry Point or Entry gate.
*void -->keyword(Reserve Word)- No return.
*static --> when class is loaded in memory, then static will load along.
*Static (Eager Loading).
*public - access outside the package(Folder).
*String args[] --> Command Line Arguments.
*args is flexible, means that we can change its name to different one.
*In Terminal -->cls to clear the terminal
*print is a predefined function whose function is to print on console.
*out object belongs to PrintStream Class and created by System Class.
*[]--> Box / Array.

Data Types
* Numeric-> Byte(-128 to 127 (-2^(8-1) to 2^(8-1)-1)), short, int, long
* Text
* Boolean

Access modifier
1. Public
2. Private
3. Protected
4. Default

System class
1. System.in --> for input
   Input
    --> Keyboard using scanner class
    --> Files
    --> Network
2. System.out --> for output
3. System.err --> for error

For input
System.in.read --> Reads one char at a time and return ASCII Value of char read.

datatypes
1. Primitive
byte      float      boolean     char
short     double
int         
long
2. Non-Primitive
-string--> belongs to wrapper class, wrapper class also contains integer, float, char, double, long.
-Array
